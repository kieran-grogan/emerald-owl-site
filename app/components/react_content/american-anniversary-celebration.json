Features To Keep In Mind: \u2022 Weather Resilience: Lasers can operate in light to moderate rain, snow, and/or wind, ensuring the show goes on despite unpredictable weather conditions. In fact, wet conditions create thousands of water droplets in the air for lasers to reflect! Rain, snow, or natural fog will actually ENHANCE your laser show in a magical way! \u2022 Environmental Considerations: Laser shows eliminate the debris and pollution associated with fireworks, offering an eco-friendly alternative. \u2022 Noise Sensitivity: The silent nature of laser shows makes them suitable for communities with noise ordinances or for individuals sensitive to loud sounds.
