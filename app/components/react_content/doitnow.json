Our Story Our Team Gallery Blog Careers Do It Now Initiative - Emerald Owl Productions Why \"Do It Now\"? In memory of Matthew Keenan Matthew Keenan was more than a friend \u2014 he was the heartbeat of Emerald Owl Productions. As our Vice President and Head Laser Technician, he poured passion into every show, every project, and every connection. He brought light \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 to every experience he worked on. In 2023, Matthew's life was tragically cut short in a car accident \u2014 one that was 100% not his fault. He was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, and the world lost someone extraordinary. In the days that followed, we kept hearing the same words: \"I wish I had told him...\" \"I regret not saying...\" The Do It Now initiative was born from that ache \u2014 and that love. This card is a reminder to act on the things that matter. To say \"I miss you.\" To say \"Thank you.\" To say \"I love you.\" To say \"I'm sorry.\" To call or write the person you've been thinking about. To take the leap. To say the words \u2014 now, while you still can. To live and love like there's no time to waste. Don't wait. Do it now.
