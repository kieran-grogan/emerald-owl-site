Our Story Our Team Gallery Blog Careers Standard In-Person Light Show Drive-in laser shows are perfect for the festive winter, while outdoor shows shine in warmer months, allowing guests to mingle and fully engage, from arm waving to dancing. Laser shows can complement festivals or be featured events, with customizable music themes\u2014from Dancing Through The Decades to Celebrate America, British Invasion, Motown, a Mix, or Christian Rock. Other advantages of a laser show: Need additional performances for an unexpected larger crowd? No worries, we easily rerun shows at minimal cost. Opt for extra nights at competitive prices, leveraging pre-paid overheads with our equipment. Choose from multiple shows, repeat runs, or varied themes to draw crowds. Let's craft your ideal event together. Why Lasers? Lasers offer the most vibrant colors for captivating, dreamlike light displays, exciting audiences with their speed and unique animation. They're versatile for indoor/outdoor settings, drive-in shows, and repeated performances without added cost. Profitable for multi-night events, they pose no fire risk. Consider laser shows as an alternative or complement to fireworks for a breathtaking event, although we don\u2019t supply fireworks, we can collaborate with those who do. Types of Laser Shows Beam Show Your audience will be captivated by the illusion of \u201cstructures\u201d floating mid-air, transforming the space with objects like rotating fans, geometric cones, and luminous shafts of light that seem to pierce the darkness. These beams of light, with their variable speeds, have the power to transform the mood and atmosphere of any event. They can inject a dynamic, \"Star Wars\" like vibrancy, full of rapid movement and sci-fi excitement, or they can create a tranquil, mystical ambiance that evokes the serenity of a New Age meditation. Either way, these visual effects add a mesmerizing layer to the experience, ensuring the event remains unforgettable. Graphic/Animation Show Audience sees specific images displayed in laser light on a large flat surface. We can display seasonal characters (ex: Santa during a Christmas show), various themes, a child\u2019s name with his/her favorite animal, a client\u2019s/sponsor\u2019s logo, or tell a story. Custom designed event or sponsor logos are also possible. A large white or lightly colored smooth surface, such as a wall, water tower, projection screen, side of a building, or thick tree line is needed. Water Effects Reflections: If your venue happens to be next to a body of water, such as a river, lake, sound, etc., let us know. If the audience can be on the other side, a beam show will now reflect in the water. Water Screen: A simply amazing and mystical way to display your images is a water screen. We may be able to do something over the top special for your production at little to no extra charge!
