Our Story Our Team Gallery Blog Careers FUN MUSIC INCLUDED! DON'T FORGET TO UNMUTE! Schedule a Neon Night Today! NEON NIGHTS Previously known as a \"Laser Light Glow Party,\" Neon Nights is our marquee, yet perhaps most misunderstood, experience. This is NOT your typical (and often underwhelming) \"Glow Party.\" The interaction we create , combined with the professional production, is the \"secret sauce\" that makes this event so memorable and unique. And yes, it is family friendly, even if you think it looks a bit like a \"rave!\" Our first \"Laser Light Glow Party,\" was in Emerald Isle on the Bogue Inlet Pier. We\nthought it would be mostly kids with their parents. And while that crowd certainly\nshowed up, so did everyone else! We saw grandparents leading dances being cheered on by teenagers on a double date! This one truly brings people of all generations together for an incredible evening! . GLOW IN THE DARK FOAM & PAINT line If you think the foam party looks fun, imagine at night with glow in the dark foam and paint!!!! Bring a change of clothes and a towel for this one, you are going to need it......but the fun memories you will leave with are going to last a long time! These can be done as stand-alone smaller events, or add a \"SPLASH ZONE\" at your outdoor laser light glow party! Rates will be dependent on day of week and how many participants! Give us a call see we can make it happen. GLOW IN THE DARK SPORTS We take any fun activity to a new level by making it glow in the dark. Some ideas may be: *Glow in the Dark Dodgeball * Glow in the Dark Basketball * Glow in the Dark Kickball Neon Nights Pricing Neon Nights are priced uniquely based on your needs and details are needed to get an accurate quote.
