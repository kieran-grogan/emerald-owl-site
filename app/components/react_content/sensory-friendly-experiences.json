Our Story Our Team Gallery Blog Careers Sensory Friendly Experiences Sensory Friendly Experiences Plan An Event That Can Include Everyone Pilot Event Experience Drive-in laser shows are a popular, weather-resistant entertainment option since 2020, with benefits like no noise worries and functionality in light rain. Customers love the stress-free, profitable drive-in experience, offering multiple nightly events and organized parking. Enjoy shows up to 45 minutes from your car, with radio-transmitted sound and optional sound systems, plus tailgating opportunities. Rain enhances the show without affecting comfort. Scale up easily for extra value and customize the event to your theme. Call 833-GLOW-EOP for versatile pricing based on venue size, power, and duration\u2014the longer the event, the better the rate. ALI CHEELY - Director of Partnership Development - \u200bDirector of Neurodivergent Events Phone: (252)570-9453 Email: [email\u00a0protected] Ali Cheely is a mother of 4 children, 3 of which have special needs, including neurological differences. Ali brings her teaching and coaching experience from school, church, and home settings to EOP. She has worked with children and adults with autism, Down syndrome, Split brain syndrome, Cerebral palsy, OCD, ADHD, global cognitive delays, and short stature/dwarfism. Ali has also worked with individuals who are non verbal and non ambulatory. \"I know how hard it is when you feel there are no events that meet the unique needs of your kids. As Director of Neurodivergent Events, my job is to create specific experiences that meet the needs of populations that are often overlooked by event planners. It is truly humbling to use my knowledge and background to create memories via epic events for these populations.\" What Separates This From Others In response to parent feedback about sensory sensitivities preventing their children from attending our events, EOP collaborated with Ali to create sensory-friendly experiences. Ali consulted parents of autistic children to identify key obstacles: large crowds, rapid flashing lights, loud and unexpected sounds, and the lack of a safe space. EOP addressed these issues by scheduling events at quieter times, modifying lights and sound for gentle transitions, lowering music volume, and designating a calm area for breaks.
