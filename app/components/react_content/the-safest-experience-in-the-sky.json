Our Story Our Team Gallery Blog Careers The Safest Experience in the Sky - Emerald Owl Productions The Safest Experience in the Sky Experience the magic of laser shows with complete peace of mind No Fire Risk Zero combustible materials used in our shows No Falling Debris Pure light entertainment with no physical projectiles No Explosive Hazards Silent operation with controlled audio delivery FAA Coordinated Full compliance with aviation safety standards Why Are Laser Shows the Safest Option for Entertainment? 1) No Explosives or Pyrotechnics Laser shows create stunning visual effects without using any combustible materials. In the rare instance flammable items are nearby (e.g., curtains), we zone the lasers to avoid those objects\u2014an extra layer of protection for added peace of mind. 2) No Falling Debris or Physical Objects Only beams of light are projected into the sky\u2014no physical objects are launched. This means zero risk of falling debris, misfires, or mid-air collisions. The experience remains fully visual and completely safe from above. 3) No Loud Explosions & Environmentally Friendly Lasers operate silently, with the soundtrack delivered via adjustable audio or FM transmitters\u2014ideal for drive-in events and areas with strict noise ordinances. Laser shows will not disturb pets, wildlife, or individuals sensitive to loud noises, making them a great option for inclusive entertainment. 4) Reliable in Various Weather Conditions Lasers function effectively in moderate wind, fog, rain, and even snow. In fact, moisture in the air enhances the show by reflecting light off thousands of tiny droplets, creating a more magical display. There's also no fire risk, even in dry or drought-prone conditions. 5) Enhanced Audience & Worker Safety Lasers can be safely positioned closer to the audience than fireworks or drone shows, providing an immersive experience without physical danger. Should a rare technical glitch or human error occur, the lasers simply shut off\u2014there's no risk of objects falling or striking people or property. Additionally, with no explosives or high-altitude installations, laser shows are among the safest entertainment options for staff and crew. 6) FAA Coordination for Outdoor Laser Shows For outdoor shows, Emerald Owl Productions files a notice with the FAA and stays in regular contact with local air traffic control. If an aircraft is nearby, we can briefly pause the show to ensure complete aerial safety. 7) Proactive Risk Management While laser shows are safe for all audiences, individuals with photosensitive epilepsy may be sensitive to fast-moving light patterns. Though we are not aware of any such incidents at our events, we are committed to transparency and caution. To ensure everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience: Clear signage and notices will be posted at the event We offer customized programming to reduce laser speed when needed Sensory-friendly experiences are available upon request, designed by Emerald Owl Productions for accessibility and inclusion Our mission is to deliver a show that's safe, inclusive, and unforgettable for everyone. 8) Safe and Responsible Operation Virtually Eliminates Risk of Serious Injury Emerald Owl Productions strictly follows ILDA (International Laser Display Association) safety standards, as well as federal regulations from the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). Key safety measures include: Pre-zoned laser beams to avoid audience exposure An emergency stop (\"E-STOP\") button within arm's reach of every laser technician Zero known reports of serious injury to audience members at U.S. laser shows where ILDA guidelines were followed While isolated incidents have occurred in other countries, they are almost always the result of unregulated use or non-professional operation. Emerald Owl Productions uses only trained technicians and professional-grade equipment to ensure the highest standards of safety. It's entertainment you can trust\u2014safe, stunning, and unforgettable.
